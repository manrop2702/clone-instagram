# Motivation
Thanks to founder Thinh Pham and all helpful mentors from CodersX, in addition to the friendly community we are in that I have enough knowledge to make almost any web design that I want.

I was always love the color concept of Instagram so I choose to remake its newsfeed page in this solo project.
